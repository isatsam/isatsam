## Hello World!
I'm a software developer with experience in back-end development, desktop software, and Linux system administration. My most used languages are Python and Go.

I'm always working on a few hobby projects at a time, some of which are pinned in my profile. Iâ€™m also always looking to collaborate on any interesting web-based projects, video game modding (tools, datamining or reverse-engineering), or Linux scripts.  

Reach me via: isatsamdev [at\] gmail [dot\] com 

### Looking for opportunities!
ðŸ™‹ I'm currently searching for a software developer position (permanent or a contract for 2+ years) within Republic of Ireland. I can work remote anywhere, or attend office within Dublin county.
